<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>What does the Bismark gateway do?</b> For now (and yes, we hope to
continue this as long as we can sustain it), we will be happy to ship
you an OpenWRT box with the Bismark firmware.  The firmware currently
takes only active measurements of your access link performance.  We are
working on a portal through which you can view your measurements (at
networkdashboard.org), but that is still under development.  In the
future, depending on user demand, we would like to develop some other
applications for the box, such as a visualization that helps users
better manage usage caps, better interfaces for QoS and security in the
home, etc. Those things are all in the works.  Please submit feature
requests! </li>

<li> <b>When can I get a device?</b> We are in the midst of our first
  pilot deployment, of about 8-10 users in Cape Town, South Africa.  If
  we can swing a deployment here, we figure anything is possible. 
  We are hoping to send you gateway devices with the Bismark firmware by
  mid-to-late June.  This is contingent on no catastrophes in the pilot
  deployment, and our ability to satisfy the volume of requests  Please
  stay tuned to this list for announcements. Sign

<li> <b>Can I help develop or test?</b> Yes.  Please see
  <a href="http://redmine.projectbismark.net">redmine.projectbismark.net</a>
  for details about how; please feel free to 
  register on that site. </li>

<li> <b>Who is funding this effort?</b> We are currently funded by the
  National Science Foundation, primarily.  We have funding from Google
  once the NSF funding runs out.  If you would like to donate to the
  project, or know of potential donors, please let us know!</li>

<li> <b>Who are you, and how did this project start?</b> Srikanth
  Sundaresan is a Ph.D. student, and Nick Feamster is an associate
  professor, both at Georgia Tech.  Dave Taht is our fearless developer
  and project manager.  This project started when we wanted to learn
  more about properties of Internet access links and realized that there
  wasn't much good data about it available.  We wanted to develop an
  open-source platform for taking these kinds of measurements.  As we've
  been developing the platform, we've been realizing the general
  usefulness of having a programmable gateway in the home.  More people
  who have contributed are
