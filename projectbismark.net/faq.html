    <h3>What does the Bismark gateway do?</h3>
    <p>For now (and yes, we hope to continue this as long as we can sustain
    it), we will be happy to ship you an OpenWRT box with the Bismark firmware.
    The firmware currently takes only active measurements of your access link
    performance.  We are working on a portal through which you can view your
    measurements (at networkdashboard.org), but that is still under
    development.  In the future, depending on user demand, we would like to
    develop some other applications for the box, such as a visualization that
    helps users better manage usage caps, better interfaces for QoS and
    security in the home, etc. Those things are all in the works.  Please
    submit feature requests!</p>

    <h3>When can I get a device?</h3>
    <p>At present, the requests for devices far outstrips our
    capability to satisfy the requests, so we may not be able to satisfy all
    requests. Please stay tuned for announcements.</p>

    <h3>How will you select participants?</h3>
    <p>We are looking for participants in regions close to <a
    href="http://measurementlab.net">measurement lab</a> servers.  We will
    initially ship gateways to users in these regions that allow us to achieve
    reasonable coverage across Internet service providers and service plans.
    We are also looking for participants in &quot;interesting&quot; places
    (e.g., foreign countries, developing regions).</p>

    <h3>Can I help develop or test BISmark?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Please contact us at bismark-core@projectbismark.net</p>

    <h3>Who is funding this effort?</h3>
    <p> We are currently funded by the National Science Foundation, primarily.
    We have funding from Google once the NSF funding runs out.  If you would
    like to donate to the project, or know of potential donors, please let us
    know!</p>

    <h3>How did this project start?</h3>
    <p>This project started when we wanted to learn more about properties of
    Internet access links and realized that there wasn't much good data about
    it available.  We wanted to develop an open-source platform for taking
    these kinds of measurements.  As we've been developing the platform, we've
    been realizing the general usefulness of having a programmable gateway in
    the home.</p>
